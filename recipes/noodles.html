    <h3>Recipe:</h3>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>

        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the noodles</li>

        <li> 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ol> 
        <li>Egg noodles are easier to make from scratch than you may think. This old-fashioned egg noodle recipe is made with flour, eggs, and salt. </li>
        If you've tried making Italian homemade pasta before but weren't thrilled with the process or results, these egg noodles are much simpler. 
        They're also easier to work with because you don't have to roll the dough out as thinly as you would for Italian-style pasta.

        <li>Cook the homemade egg noodles while still fresh, or set them out to dry and store the noodles for future use. 
        <li>As long as you have enough counter space, this recipe can be doubled or even tripled. You can also start a second batch while the first round of dough chills.</li>
       
        <li>A good substitute for pasta, serve the egg noodles with your favorite sauce. They also make an excellent noodle casserole and can be enjoyed alongside a hearty stew or used in soup.</li> 

    </ol>
